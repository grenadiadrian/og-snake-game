My take on the legendary Nokia phone game

For any of us that once (twice or thrice even!) owned a Nokia phone in the early 2000s, this game needs no introduction. For those that aren't in the know, it's like this:

- Feed snake an "apple"
- Snake grows larger, plus moves faster
- "Apples" reappear in random locations
- Your task is to keep feeding the snake until it bumps into a wall, or the head touches the body as it's moving
- Otherwise it's GAME OVER!

All credit goes to Scrimba.com and instructor Ania Kubow for showing me how it's done. I hope my remake provides you with some nostalgia as well as a way to take a little break from your work/studies. Enjoy!
